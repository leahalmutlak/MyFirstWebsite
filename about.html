    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>Dogs are not particularly bad, however they are inferior. Dogs were domesticated from wolves so they could hunt for us, protect us, and serve us.  </p>
    <h2>Cats</h2>
    <p>Cats domesticated themselves just for the fun of it and they do nothing for us yet we give them everything. Therefore this shows their superior intelligence.  </p>
